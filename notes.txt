CSS

Properties

display: Controls how elements participate in "flow layout".

Outer display type values: determine how the element with the display property aligns with its siblings 
    (horizontally or vertically)

Inner display type values: determine how the CHILDREN of the element with the display property align with each other
    (horizontally or vertically)

Example:

Horizontally:
[-][-]

Vertically:
[-------------------------------------------]
[-------------------------------------------]

Elements will align horizontally by getting their dimensions from their contents, 
    potentially leaving room in their row for siblings. 
Elements will align vertically by taking 100% of the room in their row (either with inner width or with margin),
    forcing siblings to a different row.

CSS:

/* Outer display type values */

/* Makes an element align horizontally with its siblings */
display: inline;

/* Makes an element align vertically with its siiblings */
display: block;


/* Takes the default dimensions from inline, but allows resizing like block */
display: inline-block;


/* Inner display type values */

/* ?? */
display: flex;
